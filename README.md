# Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in Coursera

These are my class notes on the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) by Andrew Ng in Coursera.
Most of its contents are based on that course, and some comments have been added from my experience.

My intention is to let anyone who finds it useful, use it to facilitate their learning.

Feel free to copy or edit it if you want.

Also, if you find any mistake or anything to fix, I will be happy to hear it from you.

I hope you enjoy it! :)
